[h2]Sleepy's More Psycasts (v1.0.0)[/h2]

[b]Credit[/b]
This mod is a fork of Noodles and DC's amazing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2460833332]More Psycasts[/url] mod. I absolutely loved their mod, so much so i approached them to fork it when 1.4 released. During this process I become worried that what I envisioned and considered balanced was skewing too far from what they originally designed. In releasing this, I supported Noodles in updating the original mod to 1.4 so as to ensure those that enjoyed that mod could continue to do so while I could make my fork exactly how I wanted too.

[b]Roadmap:[/b]
- Add VPE Compatibility (In the works but I basically have to add a second version of every psycast I add into their format so it'll take time).
- Mod Options (I did try to add this but I was having trouble getting it to work so it'll be something I need to research and look into getting to work).
- Add more relevant and balanced psycasts.

- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It will cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content).
