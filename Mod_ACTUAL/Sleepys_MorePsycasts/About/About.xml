[b]Credit[/b]
This mod was originally a fork of Noodles and DC's amazing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2460833332]More Psycasts[/url] mod. I absolutely loved their mod, so much so i approached them to fork it when 1.4 released. During this process I became worried that what I envisioned and considered balanced was skewing too far from what they originally designed. In realising this, I supported Noodles in updating the original mod to 1.4 so as to ensure those that enjoyed that mod could continue to do so while I could make my fork exactly how I wanted too.

I love to add content to this game that I feel is missing or that I'd like expanded. I figure that if I enjoy what I've added, others may too so I to post my mods to the workshop. Balance is critical to me as I am a vanilla player and I'll try to ensure nothing is unbalanced but ultimately I have a goal in mind for the content I am adding so what I consider balanced may not always be what you'd consider balanced. Hopefully you enjoy the mod none the less.

You can find all the stats and exact effects of each Psycast here:
