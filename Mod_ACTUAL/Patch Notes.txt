Update v1.0.11 Build 11/05/24 | Post 
*New psycasts only added for Rimworld version 1.5 (1.4 will only be supported with balance and bug fixes).
Some code changes will only be for 1.5 as it becomes too difficult to test and manage the branches.

Additions:
New Psycasts:
 - Engulf

Changes:
Reduced SLP_HealingPains Hediff severityPerDay from -3.0 to -3.5 (effected pawn will recover slightly faster).
Reduced SLP_HealingPains Hediff MaxSeverity from 35 to 25 (Won't stack as signficantly)
Removed SLP_HealingPains Hediff 'Extreme' Stage (Makes it easier to manage and less debilitating).

Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff severityPerDay from -0.5 to -1.0 (effected pawn will recover signficantly faster).
Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff 'Severe' Stage negatives slightly (reduced consciousness negatives)
Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff 'Extreme' Stage negatives slightly (reduced painoffset negatives)

Reduced Deep Regeneration Warmup time from 10 seconds to 5 seconds
Reduced Ignite Psyfocus cost from 5% to 2% 
Increased Ignite Neural Heat Gain from 5 to 15
Reduced Dash Psyfocus cost from 10% to 9%
Reduced Dash Neural Heat Gain from 50 to 30
Reduced Word of Sleep Psyfocus cost from 25% to 15% (Was just too high)
Reduced Word of Vigor Psyfocus cost from 55% to 35% (Too high to be useful in a variety of situations)
Increased Word of Vigor Sleep/Rest offset from +40% to +50%
Increased Potential Unleashed Consciousness offset from +10% to +15%
Increased Potential Unleashed MentalBreakThreshold from -10% to -15% (makes it harder to mentally break by an extra 5%)
Reduced Skipscreen Psyfocus cost from 18% to 15%
Reduced Skipscreen Neural Heat Gain from 65 to 55
Reduced Recondition Neural Heat Gain from 90 to 70

Adjusted Recondition Repair Formala (now ((thing.MaxHitPoints - thing.HitPoints) / 2) + (thing.MaxHitPoints / 20)) results in a slight boost to repair and reduces the diminishing returns)(1.5 only)
Increased Superficial Regeneration Scar Healing Factor from 3.0 to 6.0 (Heals twice the amount from scars now)(1.5 only)
Adjusted the display order for psycasts so it makes better sense (1.5 only)
Ingite Psycast Adjusted from code based fire spawn to a projectile fire spawn (results in a better fire and can be somewhat used in combat now)(1.5 only)

Localisation:
N/A

Bug Fixes:
N/A

Code Changes:
Changed Ignite from external code to internal code (will ensure it works for the long term and reduced code overhead)(1.5 only)
