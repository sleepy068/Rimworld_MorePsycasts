Update v1.0.11 Build 11/05/24 | Post 
*New psycasts only added for Rimworld version 1.5 (1.4 will only be supported with balance and bug fixes).
Some code changes will only be for 1.5 as it becomes too difficult to test and manage the branches.

Additions:
New Psycasts:
 - Engulf
 - Dart

Changes:
Reduced SLP_HealingPains Hediff severityPerDay from -3.0 to -3.5 (effected pawn will recover slightly faster).
Reduced SLP_HealingPains Hediff MaxSeverity from 35 to 21 (Won't stack as signficantly)
Removed SLP_HealingPains Hediff 'Serious' Stage
Removed SLP_HealingPains Hediff 'Extreme' Stage (Makes it easier to manage and less debilitating).
Balanced SLP_HealingPains Acclimatising, Minor and Major stages (increased them very slightly to adjust to the removed stages)

Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff severityPerDay from -0.5 to -1.0 (effected pawn will recover signficantly faster).
Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff 'Severe' Stage negatives slightly (reduced consciousness negatives)
Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff Stage initialSeverity from 7 to 5
Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff MaxSeverity from 21 to 15 (Won't stack as signficantly)
Reduced SLP_RegenSickness Hediff Stage minSeverity spread (results in less time on the higher stages)
Removed SLP_RegenSickness Hediff 'Extreme' Stage (Makes it easier to manage and far less debilitating if you want to spam the ability).

Reduuced Deep Regeneration psycast cost from 80% to 65%
Reduuced Deep Regeneration Neural Heat Gain from 65 to 50

Reduced Superfical Regeneration psycast cost from 40% to 35%
Reduced Superfical Regeneration Neural Heat Gain from 50 to 40
Reduced Flash Heal Psyfocus cost from 25% to 20%
Increased Flash Heal Duration from 42 ticks to 63 ticks (Ingame: 1.0 Hours to 1.5 Hours)

Reduced Recondition Neural Heat Gain from 90 to 70

Adjusted Recondition Repair Formala (now ((thing.MaxHitPoints - thing.HitPoints) / 2) + (thing.MaxHitPoints / 20)) results in a slight boost to repair and reduces the diminishing returns)(1.5 only)
Increased Superficial Regeneration Scar Healing Factor from 3.0 to 6.0 (Heals twice the amount from scars now)(1.5 only)
Adjusted the display order for psycasts so it makes better sense (1.5 only)
Ingite Psycast Adjusted from code based fire spawn to a projectile fire spawn (results in a better fire and can be somewhat used in combat now)(1.5 only)

Cleaned up the steam workshop description image (each block represents 10%, 10 or 1 second now)

Localisation:
N/A

Bug Fixes:
N/A

Code Changes:
Changed Ignite from external code to internal code (will ensure it works for the long term and reduced code overhead)(1.5 only)
