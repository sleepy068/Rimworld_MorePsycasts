Update v1.0.12 Build 16/06/24 | Post 
*New content and adjustments, excluding bug fixes, will only be made to the Rimworld 1.5 Version of this mod (just a hassle maintaining both sorry)

Additions:
Added new Psycasts:
- Endothermic Pinhole
- Supernova Pinhole
- Word of Friendship

Changes:
Arctic Pinhole min temperature reduced from -5 to -9 (Results in a colder room).
Set MustBeCapableOfViolence to false to all psycasts to help prevent issues with non violent pawns.

Dart can no longer target pawns (it is not an offensive psycast).
Dart psyfocus cost increased from 70% to 85%. (Just a little too powerful utility wise)

Localisation:
More grammer mistakes fixed.
